                This is an application that allows users to create, manage, and approve workflows within an organization. 
                It provides a user-friendly interface called "Matrix Designer" for defining workflow steps, assigning tasks, and tracking progress.

                The application also supports role-based access control with proper authentication process, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the workflow.

                Initially I was very involved in the Proof of Convept design and so I took charge of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) then moved on to creating the backend using C# and .NET Framework.                  
                As the project progressed, I took on more responsibilities in front-end development of the application using Angular and TypeScript. 
                including designing and implementing the database schema, creating RESTful APIs, and integrating with Azure services for deployment and scalability.
